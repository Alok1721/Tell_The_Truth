        "Arvind Kejriwal (Hindi pronunciation: [əɾʋin̪d̪ ked͡ʒɾiːʋaːl]; born 16 August 1968) is an Indian politician, activist and former bureaucrat, who served as the 7th Chief Minister of Delhi. He was the chief minister from 2013 to 2014 and from 2015 to 2024. He is also the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) since 2012. He has represented the New Delhi constituency in the Delhi Legislative Assembly since 2015 and from 2013 to 2014.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2006, Kejriwal was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his involvement in the Parivartan movement using right to information legislation in a campaign against government corruption. The same year, after resigning from government service, he founded the Public Cause Research Foundation to campaign for transparent governance. Before entering politics, Kejriwal had worked in the Indian Revenue Service. Prior to that, he was a mechanical engineer from IIT Kharagpur.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2012, he launched the AAP. In 2013, he assumed office as the Chief Minister of Delhi and resigned 49 days later over his inability to mobilise support for his proposed anti-corruption legislation. In the 2015 Delhi Legislative assembly elections, the AAP registered an unprecedented majority. In subsequent 2020 elections, AAP re-emerged victorious and retained power in Delhi, following which, Kejriwal was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Delhi for the third time in a row. Outside Delhi, his party registered another major victory in 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election.\n",
        "\n",
        "He was arrested on 21 March 2024 by the Enforcement Directorate on allegations of a liquor scam against the Aam Aadmi Party led Delhi Government.[1][2] He became the first ever sitting chief minister in India to be arrested.[3] His other party leaders, Satyendra Jain, Sanjay Singh and Manish Sisodia have also spent months to years in jail without bail, trial or conviction.[4] The opposition alliance called the arrest weeks before the 2024 Indian general election, a case of fabrication and \"match-fixing\" by the BJP. Amnesty International said that financial and terrorism laws have been weaponised to go after political opponents.[5] On 10 May, the Supreme Court ordered Kejriwal's release on interim bail until 1 June 2024, on account of campaigning for the election.[6][7] Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar Jail after the expiry of his bail period on 2 June 2024. On 13 September 2024, he was granted bail by Supreme Court with certain conditions, the case still continues.[8] On 17 September 2024, he resigned as Delhi Chief Minister saying he will only become CM again if he receives a public mandate.[9]\n",
        "\n",
        "Early life and education\n",
        "Kejriwal was born in an Agrawal[10] family of Baniyas in Siwani in the Bhiwani district of Haryana, India on 16 August 1968, the first of the three children of Gobind Ram Kejriwal and Gita Devi. His father was an electrical engineer who graduated from the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. Kejriwal spent most of his childhood in north Indian towns such as Sonipat, Ghaziabad and Hisar. He was educated at Campus School in Hisar[11] and at Holy Child School at Sonipat.[12] In 1985, he took the IIT-JEE exam and scored All India Rank (AIR) of 563.[13] He graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, majoring in mechanical engineering.[14]\n",
        "\n",
        "He joined Tata Steel in 1989 and was posted in Jamshedpur, Bihar. Kejriwal resigned in 1992, having taken leave of absence to study for the Civil Services Examination.[11] He spent some time in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), where he met Mother Teresa, and volunteered with The Missionaries of Charity and at the Ramakrishna Mission in North-East India and at Nehru Yuva Kendra.[15][16]\n",
        "\n",
        "Career\n",
        "Arvind Kejriwal joined the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) as an Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax in 1995, after qualifying through the Civil Services Examination.[17][18][19] In February 2006, he resigned from his position as Joint Commissioner of Income Tax in New Delhi.[17]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2012, he launched the Aam Aadmi Party, which won in the 2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election. Since 2012, he has acted as the main national convenor of AAP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Activism\n",
        "Parivartan and Kabir\n",
        "Main article: Parivartan\n",
        "In December 1999, while still in service with the Income Tax Department, Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and others founded a movement named Parivartan (which means \"change\"), in the Sundar Nagar area of Delhi. A month later, in January 2000, Kejriwal took a sabbatical from work to focus on Parivartan.[20][21]\n",
        "\n",
        "Parivartan addressed citizens' grievances related to Public Distribution System (PDS), public works, social welfare schemes, income tax and electricity. It was not a registered NGO - it ran on individual donations, and was characterised as a jan andolan (\"people's movement\") by its members.[22] Later, in 2005, Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia launched Kabir, a registered NGO named after the medieval philosopher Kabir. Like Parivartan, Kabir was also focused on RTI and participatory governance. However, unlike Parivartan, it accepted institutional donations. According to Kejriwal, Kabir was mainly run by Sisodia.[23]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2000, Parivartan filed a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding transparency in public dealings of the Income Tax department, and also organised a satyagraha outside the Chief Commissioner's office.[24] Kejriwal and other activists also stationed themselves outside the electricity department, asking visitors not to pay bribes and offered to help them in getting work done for free.[25]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2001, the Delhi government enacted a state-level Right To Information (RTI) Act, which allowed the citizens to access government records for a small fee. Parivartan used RTI to help people get their work done in government departments without paying a bribe. In 2002, the group obtained official reports on 68 public works projects in the area, and performed a community-led audit to expose misappropriations worth ₹ 7 million in 64 of the projects.[21] On 14 December 2002, Parivartan organised a Jan sunvai (public hearing), in which the citizens held public officials and leaders accountable for the lack of development in their locality.[26]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2003 (and again in 2008[27]), Parivartan exposed a PDS scam, in which ration shop dealers were siphoning off subsidised foodgrains in collusion with civic officials. In 2004, Parivartan used RTI applications to access communication between government agencies and the World Bank, regarding a project for privatisation of water supply. Kejriwal and other activists questioned the huge expenditure on the project and argued that it would hike water tariffs ten-fold, thus effectively cutting off the water supply to the city's poor. The project was stalled as a result of Parivartan's activism. Another campaign by Parivartan led to a court order that required private schools, which had received public land at discounted prices, to admit more than 700 poor kids without a fee.[24][25]\n",
        "\n",
        "Along with other social activists like Anna Hazare, Aruna Roy and Shekhar Singh, Kejriwal came to be recognised as an important contributor to the campaign for a national-level Right to Information Act (enacted in 2005).[24] He resigned from his job in February 2006, and later that year, he was given the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership, for his involvement with Parivartan.[28] The award recognised him for activating the RTI movement at the grassroots and empowering New Delhi's poor citizens to fight corruption.[25]\n",
        "\n",
        "By 2012, Parivartan was largely inactive. Sundar Nagri, where the movement was concentrated, suffered from irregular water supply, unreliable PDS system and poorly done public works.[22] Calling it \"ephemeral and delusionary in nature\", Kejriwal noted that Parivartan's success was limited, and the changes brought by it did not last long.[29]\n",
        "\n",
        "Public Cause Research Foundation\n",
        "In December 2006, Kejriwal established the Public Cause Research Foundation in December 2006, together with Manish Sisodia and Abhinandan Sekhri. He donated his Ramon Magsaysay Award prize money as a seed fund. Besides the three founders, Prashant Bhushan and Kiran Bedi served as the Foundation's trustees.[30] This new body paid the employees of Parivartan.[22] Kejriwal used the RTI Act in corruption cases in many government departments including the Income Tax Department, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the Public Distribution System and the Delhi Electricity Board.[15]\n",
        "\n",
        "Jan Lokpal movement\n",
        "Main article: 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement\n",
        "In 2010, Kejriwal protested against corruption in the Commonwealth Games. He argued that the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) did not have any powers to take any action against the guilty, while CBI was incapable of launching an unbiased investigation against the ministers who controlled it. He advocated appointment of public ombudsman - Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in states.[31]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2011, Kejriwal joined several other activists, including Anna Hazare and Kiran Bedi, to form the India Against Corruption (IAC) group. The IAC demanded enactment of the Jan Lokpal Bill, which would result in a strong ombudsman. The campaign evolved into the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement. In response to the campaign, the government's advisory body - the National Advisory Council - drafted a Lokpal Bill. However, the NAC's Bill was criticised by Kejriwal and other activists on the grounds that it did not have enough powers to take action against the prime minister, other corrupt officeholders, and the judiciary. The activists also criticised the procedure for the selection of Lokpal, the transparency clauses and the proposal to disallow the Lokpal from taking cognizance of public grievances.[32]\n",
        "\n",
        "Amid continuing protests, the Government constituted a committee to Draft a Jan Lokpal Bill. Kejriwal was one of the civil society representative members of this committee. However, he alleged that the IAC activists had an unequal position in the committee, and the government appointees kept ignoring their recommendations. The Government argued that the activists could not be allowed to blackmail the elected representatives through protests. Kejriwal retorted that democratically elected representatives could not be allowed to function like dictators, and asked for a public debate on the contentious issues.[33]\n",
        "\n",
        "The IAC activists intensified their protests, and Anna Hazare organised a hunger strike. Kejriwal and other activists were arrested for defying a police directive to give a written undertaking that they will not go to JP Park. Kejriwal attacked the government on this and said there was a need for a debate over police power to detain and release people at will.[34][35] In August 2011, a settlement was reached between the Government and the activists.[36]\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides the government, the Jan Lokpal movement was also criticised by some citizens as 'undemocratic' on the grounds that the ombudsman had powers over elected representatives. Arundhati Roy claimed that the movement was not a people's movement; instead, it was funded by foreigners to influence policymaking in India. She pointed out that the Ford Foundation had funded the Emergent Leadership category of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and also donated $397,000 to Kejriwal's NGO Kabir.[37] Both Kejriwal and Ford Foundation termed the allegations as baseless, stating that the donations were made to support the RTI campaigns. Besides, several other Indian organisations had also received grants from the Ford Foundation.[38][39] Kejriwal also denied the allegations that the movement was a plot against the ruling Congress by the RSS, or that it was an upper-caste conspiracy against the Dalits.[23]\n",
        "\n",
        "By January 2012, the Government had backtracked on its promise to implement a strong Jan Lokpal, resulting in another series of protests from Kejriwal and his fellow activists. These protests attracted lower participation compared to the 2011 protests.[40] By mid-2012, Kejriwal had replaced Anna Hazare as the face of the remaining protestors.[41] In January 2014, Kejriwal said that he will quit from the government if Jan Lokpal Bill is not passed.[42]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2015, during the second term of the AAP government in Delhi, the Jan Lokpal Bill was passed by the assembly awaiting the president's approval.[43]\n",
        "\n",
        "National Convener of AAP\n",
        "\n",
        "Kejriwal during the launch of AAP in Bangalore, in July 2013\n",
        "One of the major criticisms directed at the Jan Lokpal activists was that they had no right to dictate terms to the elected representatives. As a result, Kejriwal and other activists decided to enter politics and contest elections.[44] In November 2012, they formally launched the Aam Aadmi Party; Kejriwal was elected as the party's National Convener. The party name reflects the phrase Aam Aadmi, or \"common man\", whose interests Kejriwal proposed to represent.[45] The establishment of AAP caused a rift between Kejriwal and Hazare.[46]\n",
        "\n",
        "AAP decided to contest the 2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election, with Kejriwal contesting against the incumbent Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. Kejriwal became the fifth most-mentioned Indian politician on social media channels in the run-up to the elections.[47]\n",
        "\n",
        "During the NDTV Townhall event before the 2022 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Arvind Kejriwal said, \"The people of Goa have a choice between AAP and BJP. If you want a clean, honest government, you can vote for AAP. The other option is to vote for the BJP directly or indirectly. Indirect voting is when you vote for the Congress, that Congress man will win and go to the BJP.\"[48] Later on in September 2022, 8 out of 11 Congress MLAs joined BJP.\n",

        "In the 2013, Delhi Legislative Assembly elections for all 70 seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party won 31 seats, followed by Aam Aadmi Party with 28 seats.[49] Kejriwal defeated incumbent Chief Minister, Sheila Dikshit of the Indian National Congress (INC), in her constituency of New Delhi[50] by a margin of 25,864 votes.[51]\n",
        "\n",
        "AAP formed a minority government in the hung assembly, (claiming support for the action gauged from opinion polls) with outside support from the eight INC MLAs, one Janata Dal MLA and one independent MLA.[52][53] Kejriwal was sworn in as the second-youngest chief minister of Delhi on 28 December 2013, after Chaudhary Brahm Prakash who became chief minister at the age of 34.[54][55] He was in charge of Delhi's home, power, planning, finance, services and vigilance ministries.[56]\n",
        "\n",
        "On 14 February 2014, he resigned as Chief Minister after failing to table the Jan Lokpal Bill in the Delhi Assembly. He recommended the dissolution of the Assembly.[57] Kejriwal blamed the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party for stalling the anti-corruption legislation and linked it with the government's decision to register a First Information Report (FIR) against industrialist Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries.[58] In April 2014 he said that he had made a mistake by resigning without publicly explaining the rationale behind his decision.[59]\n",

            "Arvind Kejriwal (Hindi pronunciation: [əɾʋin̪d̪ ked͡ʒɾiːʋaːl]; born 16 August 1968) is an Indian politician, activist and former bureaucrat, who served as the 7th Chief Minister of Delhi. He was the chief minister from 2013 to 2014 and from 2015 to 2024. He is also the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) since 2012. He has represented the New Delhi constituency in the Delhi Legislative Assembly since 2015 and from 2013 to 2014.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2006, Kejriwal was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his involvement in the Parivartan movement using right to information legislation in a campaign against government corruption. The same year, after resigning from government service, he founded the Public Cause Research Foundation to campaign for transparent governance. Before entering politics, Kejriwal had worked in the Indian Revenue Service. Prior to that, he was a mechanical engineer from IIT Kharagpur.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2012, he launched the AAP. In 2013, he assumed office as the Chief Minister of Delhi and resigned 49 days later over his inability to mobilise support for his proposed anti-corruption legislation. In the 2015 Delhi Legislative assembly elections, the AAP registered an unprecedented majority. In subsequent 2020 elections, AAP re-emerged victorious and retained power in Delhi, following which, Kejriwal was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Delhi for the third time in a row. Outside Delhi, his party registered another major victory in 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election.\n",
            "\n",
            "He was arrested on 21 March 2024 by the Enforcement Directorate on allegations of a liquor scam against the Aam Aadmi Party led Delhi Government.[1][2] He became the first ever sitting chief minister in India to be arrested.[3] His other party leaders, Satyendra Jain, Sanjay Singh and Manish Sisodia have also spent months to years in jail without bail, trial or conviction.[4] The opposition alliance called the arrest weeks before the 2024 Indian general election, a case of fabrication and \"match-fixing\" by the BJP. Amnesty International said that financial and terrorism laws have been weaponised to go after political opponents.[5] On 10 May, the Supreme Court ordered Kejriwal's release on interim bail until 1 June 2024, on account of campaigning for the election.[6][7] Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar Jail after the expiry of his bail period on 2 June 2024. On 13 September 2024, he was granted bail by Supreme Court  with certain conditions, the case still continues.[8] On 17 September 2024, he resigned as Delhi Chief Minister saying he will only become CM again if he receives a public mandate.[9]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kejriwal was born in an Agrawal[10] family of Baniyas in Siwani in the Bhiwani district of Haryana, India on 16 August 1968, the first of the three children of Gobind Ram Kejriwal and Gita Devi. His father was an electrical engineer who graduated from the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. Kejriwal spent most of his childhood in north Indian towns such as Sonipat, Ghaziabad and Hisar. He was educated at Campus School in Hisar[11] and at Holy Child School at Sonipat.[12] In 1985, he took the IIT-JEE exam and scored All India Rank (AIR) of 563.[13] He graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, majoring in mechanical engineering.[14]\n",
            "\n",
            "He joined Tata Steel in 1989 and was posted in Jamshedpur, Bihar. Kejriwal resigned in 1992, having taken leave of absence to study for the Civil Services Examination.[11] He spent some time in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), where he met Mother Teresa, and volunteered with The Missionaries of Charity and at the Ramakrishna Mission in North-East India and at Nehru Yuva Kendra.[15][16]\n",
            "\n",
            "Arvind Kejriwal joined the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) as an Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax in 1995, after qualifying through the Civil Services Examination.[17][18][19] In February 2006, he resigned from his position as Joint Commissioner of Income Tax in New Delhi.[17]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2012, he launched the Aam Aadmi Party, which won in the 2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election. Since 2012, he has acted as the main national convenor of AAP.\n",
            "\n",
            "In December 1999, while still in service with the Income Tax Department, Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and others founded a movement named Parivartan (which means \"change\"), in the Sundar Nagar area of Delhi. A month later, in January 2000, Kejriwal took a sabbatical from work to focus on Parivartan.[20][21]\n",
            "\n",
            "Parivartan addressed citizens' grievances related to Public Distribution System (PDS), public works, social welfare schemes, income tax and electricity. It was not a registered NGO - it ran on individual donations, and was characterised as a jan andolan (\"people's movement\") by its members.[22] Later, in 2005, Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia launched Kabir, a registered NGO named after the medieval philosopher Kabir. Like Parivartan, Kabir was also focused on RTI and participatory governance. However, unlike Parivartan, it accepted institutional donations. According to Kejriwal, Kabir was mainly run by Sisodia.[23]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2000, Parivartan filed a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding transparency in public dealings of the Income Tax department, and also organised a satyagraha outside the Chief Commissioner's office.[24] Kejriwal and other activists also stationed themselves outside the electricity department, asking visitors not to pay bribes and offered to help them in getting work done for free.[25]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2001, the Delhi government enacted a state-level Right To Information (RTI) Act, which allowed the citizens to access government records for a small fee. Parivartan used RTI to help people get their work done in government departments without paying a bribe. In 2002, the group obtained official reports on 68 public works projects in the area, and performed a community-led audit to expose misappropriations worth ₹ 7 million in 64 of the projects.[21] On 14 December 2002, Parivartan organised a Jan sunvai (public hearing), in which the citizens held public officials and leaders accountable for the lack of development in their locality.[26]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2003 (and again in 2008[27]), Parivartan exposed a PDS scam, in which ration shop dealers were siphoning off subsidised foodgrains in collusion with civic officials. In 2004, Parivartan used RTI applications to access communication between government agencies and the World Bank, regarding a project for privatisation of water supply. Kejriwal and other activists questioned the huge expenditure on the project and argued that it would hike water tariffs ten-fold, thus effectively cutting off the water supply to the city's poor. The project was stalled as a result of Parivartan's activism. Another campaign by Parivartan led to a court order that required private schools, which had received public land at discounted prices, to admit more than 700 poor kids without a fee.[24][25]\n",
            "\n",
            "Along with other social activists like Anna Hazare, Aruna Roy and Shekhar Singh, Kejriwal came to be recognised as an important contributor to the campaign for a national-level Right to Information Act (enacted in 2005).[24] He resigned from his job in February 2006, and later that year, he was given the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership, for his involvement with Parivartan.[28] The award recognised him for activating the RTI movement at the grassroots and empowering New Delhi's poor citizens to fight corruption.[25]\n",
            "\n",
            "By 2012, Parivartan was largely inactive. Sundar Nagri, where the movement was concentrated, suffered from irregular water supply, unreliable PDS system and poorly done public works.[22] Calling it \"ephemeral and delusionary in nature\", Kejriwal noted that Parivartan's success was limited, and the changes brought by it did not last long.[29]\n",
            "\n",
            "In December 2006, Kejriwal established the Public Cause Research Foundation in December 2006, together with Manish Sisodia and Abhinandan Sekhri. He donated his Ramon Magsaysay Award prize money as a seed fund. Besides the three founders, Prashant Bhushan and Kiran Bedi served as the Foundation's trustees.[30] This new body paid the employees of Parivartan.[22] Kejriwal used the RTI Act in corruption cases in many government departments including the Income Tax Department, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the Public Distribution System and the Delhi Electricity Board.[15]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2010, Kejriwal protested against corruption in the Commonwealth Games. He argued that the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) did not have any powers to take any action against the guilty, while CBI was incapable of launching an unbiased investigation against the ministers who controlled it. He advocated appointment of public ombudsman - Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in states.[31]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2011, Kejriwal joined several other activists, including Anna Hazare and Kiran Bedi, to form the India Against Corruption (IAC) group. The IAC demanded enactment of the Jan Lokpal Bill, which would result in a strong ombudsman. The campaign evolved into the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement. In response to the campaign, the government's advisory body - the National Advisory Council - drafted a Lokpal Bill. However, the NAC's Bill was criticised by Kejriwal and other activists on the grounds that it did not have enough powers to take action against the prime minister, other corrupt officeholders, and the judiciary. The activists also criticised the procedure for the selection of Lokpal, the transparency clauses and the proposal to disallow the Lokpal from taking cognizance of public grievances.[32]\n",
            "\n",
            "Amid continuing protests, the Government constituted a committee to Draft a Jan Lokpal Bill. Kejriwal was one of the civil society representative members of this committee. However, he alleged that the IAC activists had an unequal position in the committee, and the government appointees kept ignoring their recommendations. The Government argued that the activists could not be allowed to blackmail the elected representatives through protests. Kejriwal retorted that democratically elected representatives could not be allowed to function like dictators, and asked for a public debate on the contentious issues.[33]\n",
            "\n",
            "The IAC activists intensified their protests, and Anna Hazare organised a hunger strike. Kejriwal and other activists were arrested for defying a police directive to give a written undertaking that they will not go to JP Park. Kejriwal attacked the government on this and said there was a need for a debate over police power to detain and release people at will.[34][35] In August 2011, a settlement was reached between the Government and the activists.[36]\n",
            "\n",
            "Besides the government, the Jan Lokpal movement was also criticised by some citizens as 'undemocratic' on the grounds that the ombudsman had powers over elected representatives. Arundhati Roy claimed that the movement was not a people's movement; instead, it was funded by foreigners to influence policymaking in India. She pointed out that the Ford Foundation had funded the Emergent Leadership category of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and also donated $397,000 to Kejriwal's NGO Kabir.[37] Both Kejriwal and Ford Foundation termed the allegations as baseless, stating that the donations were made to support the RTI campaigns. Besides, several other Indian organisations had also received grants from the Ford Foundation.[38][39] Kejriwal also denied the allegations that the movement was a plot against the ruling Congress by the RSS, or that it was an upper-caste conspiracy against the Dalits.[23]\n",
            "\n",
            "By January 2012, the Government had backtracked on its promise to implement a strong Jan Lokpal, resulting in another series of protests from Kejriwal and his fellow activists. These protests attracted lower participation compared to the 2011 protests.[40] By mid-2012, Kejriwal had replaced Anna Hazare as the face of the remaining protestors.[41] In January 2014, Kejriwal said that he will quit from the government if Jan Lokpal Bill is not passed.[42]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2015, during the second term of the AAP government in Delhi, the Jan Lokpal Bill was passed by the assembly awaiting the president's approval.[43]\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the major criticisms directed at the Jan Lokpal activists was that they had no right to dictate terms to the elected representatives. As a result, Kejriwal and other activists decided to enter politics and contest elections.[44] In November 2012, they formally launched the Aam Aadmi Party; Kejriwal was elected as the party's National Convener. The party name reflects the phrase Aam Aadmi, or \"common man\", whose interests Kejriwal proposed to represent.[45] The establishment of AAP caused a rift between Kejriwal and Hazare.[46]\n",
            "\n",
            "AAP decided to contest the 2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election, with Kejriwal contesting against the incumbent Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. Kejriwal became the fifth most-mentioned Indian politician on social media channels in the run-up to the elections.[47]\n",
            "\n",
            "During the NDTV Townhall event before the 2022 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Arvind Kejriwal said, \"The people of Goa have a choice between AAP and BJP. If you want a clean, honest government, you can vote for AAP. The other option is to vote for the BJP directly or indirectly. Indirect voting is when you vote for the Congress, that Congress man will win and go to the BJP.\"[48] Later on in September 2022, 8 out of 11 Congress MLAs joined BJP.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the 2013, Delhi Legislative Assembly elections for all 70 seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party won 31 seats, followed by Aam Aadmi Party with 28 seats.[49] Kejriwal defeated incumbent Chief Minister, Sheila Dikshit of the Indian National Congress (INC), in her constituency of New Delhi[50] by a margin of 25,864 votes.[51]\n",
            "\n",
            "AAP formed a minority government in the hung assembly, (claiming support for the action gauged from opinion polls) with outside support from the eight INC MLAs, one Janata Dal MLA and one independent MLA.[52][53] Kejriwal was sworn in as the second-youngest chief minister of Delhi on 28 December 2013, after Chaudhary Brahm Prakash who became chief minister at the age of 34.[54][55] He was in charge of Delhi's home, power, planning, finance, services and vigilance ministries.[56]\n",
            "\n",
            "On 14 February 2014, he resigned as Chief Minister after failing to table the Jan Lokpal Bill in the Delhi Assembly. He recommended the dissolution of the Assembly.[57] Kejriwal blamed the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party for stalling the anti-corruption legislation and linked it with the government's decision to register a First Information Report (FIR) against industrialist Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries.[58] In April 2014 he said that he had made a mistake by resigning without publicly explaining the rationale behind his decision.[59]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kejriwal led Aam Aadmi Party won 67 of the 70 constituencies in the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, leaving the BJP with three seats and the INC with none.[60] In those elections, he was again elected from the New Delhi constituency, defeating Nupur Sharma by 31,583 votes.[61] He took oath on 14 February 2015 as Delhi's chief minister for a second time at Ramlila Maidan.[62][63] Since then his party has passed the Jan Lokpal Bill though with some differences.[43][64]\n",
            "\n",
            "There has been a long-running dispute between Kejriwal's office and that of the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi during Kejriwal's second term as Chief Minister. Various issues have been involved, relating which office has ultimate responsibility for various aspects of government, including some significant public appointments. Manish Sisodia characterised it as \"a battle between the selected and the elected\" and indicated after a legal setback that the government was prepared to take the issues to the Supreme Court of India.[65]\n",

Mohalla Clinics offer a basic package of essential health services including medicines, diagnostics, and consultation free of cost.[68] These clinics serve as the first point of contact for the population, offer timely services, and reduce the load of referrals to secondary and tertiary health facilities in the state.[69] Beginning in October 2019, New Delhi began rolling out free bus transit for women on the Delhi Transport Corporation, with women travelling for free when using pink tickets carrying a message from Kejriwal.[70] He has been criticised for his controversial remarks over Biharis and \"outsiders\".[71][72][73]\n",

He petitioned that the attack and vandalisation appeared to have been carried out with the \"tacit complicity\" of Delhi police.[86] The petition said, \"On March 30, 2022, several BJP goons, in the garb of a protest, launched an attack on the official residence of the Delhi CM\", \"Videos and photographs show that these goons casually walked through the security cordon [maintained by Delhi police], kicked and broke the boom barrier, broke the CCTVs cameras with 'lathis', threw paint on the gate of the residence and almost climbed over the gate, while Delhi police personnel simply looked on, doing little to stop the protesters.\"[86]\n",

The petition noted, \"It thus appears that Delhi Police was hand in glove with the goons as the goons are members of the ruling party in the Central Government, which has absolute control over the Delhi Police through the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is pertinent to note, that in the past as well, on December 10, 2020, there was an attack on the residence of the Deputy Chief Minister by BJP Goons, where also, the Delhi Police did not take any steps to stop the attackers and thereafter failed to take any concrete criminal action against the attackers.\"[87]\n",

            "Aam Aadmi Party (AAP),  political party in India formed by Arvind Kejriwal in November 2012, in the wake of the 2011 anti-corruption movement in India. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP; “Common Man’s Party”) is headquartered in New Delhi. It has served as the ruling party in the national capital territory of Delhi (2013–14 and 2015– ) as well as in the Indian state of Punjab (2022– ), and it has won seats in the legislative assemblies in Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, and Goa. The AAP’s party symbol is a broom.\n",
            "The anti-corruption movement India Against Corruption (IAC) arose in India in 2011 under the leadership of activist Anna Hazare after several corruption scandals were unearthed during the Indian National Congress–led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime. The protesters demanded a Jan Lokpal Bill (Citizen’s Ombudsman Bill) to create an independent citizen-driven body to investigate and prosecute corruption cases against people holding public office in the country. The Jan Lokpal Bill became law as the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, after being passed by both houses of parliament in India on December 18, 2013. It received the president’s assent on January 1, 2014, and came into force on January 16. The law mandates that all preliminary investigations or inquiries be completed within 30 days of receiving a complaint, with the possibility of an extension of up to three months, provided written reasons are given. The inquiry itself must be completed within six months, extendable by an additional six months. The trial is to be concluded within one year of filing the case. This period may be extended by three months, with further extensions of three months each time if justified in writing, though the total time should not exceed two years. The law also seeks to provide protection to individuals who report instances of corruption.\n",
            "As protests continued without success, one faction of the activists, led by former Indian Revenue Service officer Arvind Kejriwal, concluded that the only way to change the system was from within, by joining politics and entering government. This led to an ideological split between Kejriwal and Hazare, the latter favoring a nonpolitical approach to passing the Jan Lokpal Bill.\n",
            "Kejriwal launched the AAP on November 26, 2012, the anniversary of the adoption of the Indian constitution. The new party differed from several other Indian political parties in that Kejriwal was neither politically affiliated with any existing party nor related to an established political leader. The AAP’s leadership asserts that the party’s existence derives from a popular movement against corruption and has often described the party itself as a group of people reluctant to enter politics but left with no other avenue to fight political corruption. The broom, the AAP’s symbol, is a reference to the party’s intention to “sweep away” corruption. Party supporters often wear a white Gandhi cap emblazoned with the broom symbol, the letters AAP, and the party slogans in Hindi: “Main aam aadmi hoon” (“I am a common man”) and “Mujhe swaraj chahiye” (“I want self-governance”).\n",
            "The AAP is known for its extensive use of social media to engage with citizens in an effort, followers say, to circumvent corporate control over traditional media channels. The AAP also focuses on cultivating grassroots workers to connect with citizens at a local level.\n",
            "The AAP first entered the political arena in 2013 by contesting the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections. It exceeded most expectations, emerging as the second largest party in Delhi, with 28 seats in the 70-seat assembly, behind only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won 31 seats. The AAP won 30 percent of all votes. The assembly was hung—no party won a clear majority—but in order to form a government the AAP allied with the Indian National Congress (Congress Party), which it had targeted as being extremely corrupt. With this alliance, Kejriwal became chief minister of Delhi, replacing incumbent Congress Party leader Sheila Dikshit, who had held the post since 1998. The new AAP-led government, however, lasted only 49 days. The AAP attempted to pass a Jan Lokpal Bill for Delhi but failed to do so when the Congress Party and the BJP refused to move forward with it, after which the Congress Party withdrew its support for the AAP-led government. Kejriwal then resigned as chief minister until new elections could be held.\n",
            "In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Aam Aadmi Party put forward 432 candidates, aiming to increase its chances of achieving national party status with the Election Commission. Ultimately, four AAP candidates won, all from Punjab, which led to its recognition as a state party there. Despite receiving 32.9 percent of the votes in Delhi, the AAP did not secure any seats there. The party acknowledged the regional differences affecting its members and launched Mission Vistar (“Mission Expand”) to revamp the party’s organizational structure and grassroots presence across various states.\n",
            "Elections to the Delhi Legislative Assembly were held again in 2015, and this time the AAP won in a landslide, taking 67 of the 70 seats and 54.3 percent of votes. Kejriwal became Delhi’s chief minister, leading a cabinet of six ministers. The BJP won the remaining 3 seats, while the Congress Party won none.\n",
            "In the 2020 legislative elections the AAP continued to hold power in Delhi, winning 62 of 70 seats. In 2022 the party came to power in Punjab state with a landslide win, claiming 92 of 117 seats, and Bhagwant Mann was appointed chief minister. The AAP also won 5 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Gujarat and 2 seats in Goa’s Legislative Assembly; these successes led to the AAP’s being recognized as a “national party”—a designation that allows it to access resources, secure certain campaign privileges, and contest elections across the country—for winning at least 6 percent of votes in the previous election within at least four states. In 2024 AAP participated in the Lok Sabha elections but faced challenges, securing only 3 seats out of 22 contested. However, it continued to strengthen its organizational structure ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, expected in early 2025.\n",
            "On March 21, 2024, Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED; India’s financial crimes investigative unit) for alleged corruption. He had been under investigation in relation to a policy his government in Delhi instituted in 2021 that shifted liquor sales from government-licensed retailers to privately licensed retailers. It was alleged that AAP leaders gave preferential treatment to certain retailers, accepted bribes, engaged in money laundering, and benefited financially from kickback schemes while the policy, which was scrapped in 2022, was in place. Kejriwal was arrested after failing to appear before the ED for questioning after nine summonses. He was granted bail by the Supreme Court on September 13, 2024, and resigned his post as chief minister days after leaving jail. AAP leader Atishi was announced as his successor until the next assembly election.\n",

The AAP is currently the governing party in the Indian state of Punjab and the union territory of Delhi.

            "Massive anti-corruption protests and strikes in 2011 were initiated by a well known social activist Anna Hazare in response to exposure of unprecedented financial scams and corruption by erstwhile UPA government. The aim was to press the government to enact a strong and effective Lokpal (Federal Ombudsman) through a Jan Lokpal Bill.[42] Hazare was supported by a clutch of activists and professionals which became popularly known as Team Anna. Team Anna also included a civil-servant turned activist Arvind Kejriwal.[43][44] Hazare had wanted to keep the movement politically neutral but Kejriwal considered that direct involvement in politics was necessary because attempts to obtain progress regarding the Jan Lokpal Bill through talks with existing political parties had, in his opinion, achieved nothing. A survey conducted on a Facebook page that purported to be operated by India Against Corruption[45] and other social networking services had indicated that there was wide support for politicisation.[46][47] Hazare rejected the poll, saying \"elections require huge funds, which will be tough for activists to organise without compromising on their values\". He also said it would be difficult to ensure that candidates are not corrupted once elected.[48][49] Hazare and Kejriwal agreed on 19 September 2012 that their differences regarding a role in politics were irreconcilable. Kejriwal had support from some anti-corruption movement activists, such as Prashant Bhushan and Shanti Bhushan, but was opposed by others such as Kiran Bedi and Santosh Hegde. On 2 October,[50] Kejriwal announced that he was forming a political party and that he intended the formal launch to be on 26 November, coinciding with the anniversary of India's adoption of its Constitution in 1949.[46][47]\n",

Both the Council and the Executive were expected to have more members in due course, with the intention being that all districts and all classes of people would have a voice.[47] Various committees were proposed to be formed to draft proposals for adoption by the party in a process that was expected to take several months. Although one aim was to limit nepotism, there were complaints at this initial meeting that the selection of people invited to attend was itself an example of such practices.[51] The party was formally launched in Delhi on 26 November[52] and in March 2013, it was registered as a political party by the Election Commission of India.[53][b]\n",

He said that the AAP would put 10,000 advertisements on auto rickshaws as a protest.[66] In retrospect, after Kejriwal had been elected and then resigned his position, a union representing the drivers expressed dissatisfaction, saying: \"Arvind Kejriwal, who had won the elections because of the support of the auto drivers, has betrayed them by not fulfilling any of the promises made before the elections\".[67]\n",

It claimed that the common people of India remain unheard and unseen except when it suits politicians. The AAP's goal is to reverse the way that government accountability operates, and the party takes an interpretation of the Gandhian socialist concept of swaraj as a tenet. It believes that through swaraj, the government will be directly accountable to the people instead of higher officials.

            "Arvind Kejriwal (born August 16, 1968, Hisar, Haryana state, India) is an Indian social activist and politician best known for being the founder and leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP; “Common Man’s Party”). A former Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer turned activist, he founded the AAP in 2012 and led it to a landslide victory in the 2015 Delhi Legislative Assembly elections. He served three terms as chief minister of Delhi.\n",
            "Kejriwal was born in Hisar, a city in Haryana state, India. He went on to study mechanical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in West Bengal state, graduating in 1989.\n",
            "Kejriwal worked at Tata Steel in Jamshedpur from 1989 to 1992 before resigning to prepare for the Civil Services Examination in order to enter into government service work. He met Mother Teresa in Calcutta (Kolkata) during this break and performed volunteer work with the Missionaries of Charity for two months. Kejriwal took the Civil Services Examination and began working at the IRS in 1995. He met his future wife, Sunita Agarwal, a fellow IRS officer, during training at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy of Administration in Mussoorie.\n",
            "While working at the Income Tax Department in Delhi, Kejriwal was frustrated by the way his department functioned. In 1999, using donations from family members, he started the organization Parivartan (Hindi: “Change”), which worked to address citizens’ grievances related to public works, food rations, income tax, and electricity. Parivartan identified several misappropriations of funds in public works projects by using the Right to Information Act, which allows citizens to access government records.\n",
            "In 2006 he was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership—a recognition for social transformation and leadership in Asia—for his work with Parivartan. He resigned from the IRS the same year to become a full-time activist and donated his Magsaysay award money to found the Public Cause Research Foundation, a nongovernmental organization. In 2012 he published a book entitled Swaraj (“Self-governance”), in which he describes his views on corruption and Indian democracy.\n",
            "Kejriwal joined the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement, led by activists Anna Hazare and Kiran Bedi, that arose in India in 2011 after several corruption scandals were unearthed during the Indian National Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime. The protesters demanded the passage of what became known as the Jan Lokpal Bill (Citizen’s Ombudsman Bill) to create an independent, citizen-driven body to investigate and prosecute corruption cases against people holding public office.\n",
            "As protests continued without success, the faction led by Kejriwal, who had courted arrest during the protests, concluded that the only way to change the system was from within by running for government office. This led to an ideological split between Kejriwal and Hazare, with the latter favoring a nonpolitical approach to passing the Jan Lokpal Bill.\n",
            "Kejriwal formally launched the Aam Aadmi Party on November 26, 2012. It differed from several other Indian political parties in that Kejriwal had not been politically affiliated with any existing party nor was he a relative of an established political leader. The election symbol chosen was a broom, suggesting an intention to “sweep away” corruption from the country.\n",
            "The AAP first entered the political arena in 2013 by contesting in the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections. They exceeded most expectations and emerged as the second-largest party in Delhi, with 28 seats in the 70-seat assembly. Kejriwal defeated the incumbent chief minister, Sheila Dikshit. The assembly was hung—no party had a clear majority—and in order to form a government the AAP ended up taking support from the Indian National Congress (Congress Party)—a party it had targeted as being extremely corrupt. Kejriwal then became chief minister of Delhi. The government, however, lasted only 49 days. The AAP attempted to pass the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill but failed when the Congress Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) refused to move forward with the bill, after which the Congress Party withdrew its support for the AAP-led government. Kejriwal then resigned as chief minister of Delhi until new elections could be held.\n",
            "Elections for the Delhi Legislative Assembly were held again in 2015. This time the AAP won in a landslide, taking 67 of the 70 seats and 54.3 percent of votes, and Kejriwal again became chief minister. He led the party to another electoral victory in the 2020 elections, winning 62 of the 70 seats. The AAP also came to power in the state of Punjab and won legislative seats in Goa and Gujarat states in 2022.\n",
            "On March 21, 2024, a month prior to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED; India’s financial crimes investigative unit) for alleged corruption. Kejriwal had been under investigation in relation to a policy his government in Delhi instituted in 2021 that shifted liquor sales from government-licensed retailers to privately licensed retailers. It was alleged that AAP leaders gave preferential treatment to certain retailers, accepted bribes, engaged in money laundering, and benefited financially from kickback schemes while the policy, which was scrapped in 2022, was in place. Kejriwal was arrested after failing to appear before the ED for questioning after nine summonses. He was granted bail by the Supreme Court on September 13, 2024, and resigned his post as chief minister days after leaving jail. AAP leader Atishi was announced as his successor until the next assembly election.\n",

            "A couple of days after his release from Delhi's Tihar Jail, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal surprised all with the unexpected. He said he would resign in two days. That was a surprise because all this while, he had resisted the demand from the BJP to quit the CM's post.\n",
            "\"I will not sit on that chair till the people announce their verdict... I got justice from the legal court, now I will get justice from the people's court. I will sit in the Chief Minister's chair only after the order of the people,\" Kejriwal, the AAP national convener, said.\n",
            "Why is Kejriwal resigning as the CM when he has been released from Tihar Jail by the Supreme Court, albeit with tough bail conditions? \n",
            "From removing the corruption taint to beating anti-incumbency to gaining from the anti-BJP momentum in the Opposition camp, Arvind Kejriwal, the decision to resign and call for early elections can be seen as a political sixer.1. NOTHING TO LOSE. DELHI ASSEMBLY POLLS JUST MONTHS AWAY\n",
            "The Delhi Assembly election was slated for February 2025. With less than five months left, Kejriwal's move to resign and call for the advancement of election dates is an attempt to return to power in Delhi.\n",
            "Anyway, the Supreme Court's tough bail conditions would not have allowed Kejriwal to act as the Chief Minister.\n",
            "\"The elections are supposed to be held in February. I demand elections be held in November with Maharashtra elections,\" Kejriwal said, making his intentions clear.\n",
            "The timing of the resignation announcement is crucial as it allows him to position himself as a victim of what he and his party term as \"vendetta politics\" by the BJP-led central government. \n",
            "Even if the elections are held in February, rather than November as Kejriwal prefers, having a different Chief Minister will work to his advantage. The AAP is mostly a one-man show, and that any CM would work under Kejriwal's guidance is no secret.\n",
            "It will be a Kejriwal show with a different face, that too for a very brief period.\n",
            "By stepping down, Kejriwal might be aiming to galvanise public sympathy and mobilise his base, potentially translating into electoral gains in the upcoming polls.2. A STROKE TO SHED AAP'S CORRUPTION TAINT\n",
            "One of the primary reasons behind Kejriwal's resignation could be the ongoing corruption allegations against him, his former Deputy Chief Minister, Manish Sisodia, and others from AAP. The excise policy case has been a thorn in the side of the AAP, with both leaders facing legal battles and public scrutiny. \n",
            "The AAP, which was born out of an anti-corruption movement in 2011, its leader, Kejriwal, by stepping down, would aim to distance himself from these allegations and seek a fresh mandate from the people, effectively turning the tables on his critics.\n",
            "Kejriwal's strategy, which the party hinted at, might be to present his resignation as a form of 'agnipariksha' or trial by fire, where he would look to prove his honesty through the public's verdict. It could garner sympathy and support, and position him as a leader willing to face the people's judgment rather than clinging to power under a cloud of corruption.3. BID TO BEAT ANTI-INCUMBENCY AND REINVENT AAP\n",
            "Arvind Kejriwal has been the Chief Minister of Delhi since December 2013, with his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) holding power continuously, except for a year under Central rule (2014-2015). Anti-incumbency is, most probably, a significant challenge for the AAP seeking re-election. By resigning and calling for early elections, Kejriwal is attempting to preempt this issue.\n",
            "Moreover, by stepping down and seeking a fresh mandate, Kejriwal is essentially resetting the clock on his tenure. This would allow him to campaign on a clean slate, with a fresh CM face, focusing on his party's achievements and future promises rather than being bogged down by the baggage of a decade-long incumbency.\n",
            "The upcoming resignation would also allow the AAP to consolidate the party's unity and strategy, under the national convenor's watch, who has walked out of the jail after sometime.4. TRYING TO GAIN FROM OPPOSITION'S ANTI-BJP NOISE\n",
            "The current term of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is set to conclude in February 2025, but Kejriwal's call for elections in November 2024 aligns with the assembly election schedules of states like Maharashtra and Jharkhand.\n",
            "The current political climate, following the 2024 Lok Sabha election, is marked by a growing sense of discontent against the ruling BJP.\n",
            "In Maharashtra, the BJP, which is a part of the incumbent government led by Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar's NCP, is facing anger on several fronts, including the Maratha reservation issue.\n",
            "Likewise, in Jharkhand, the BJP has been trying hard to wrestle out the JMM-led Mahagathbandhan. In the recent past, the BJP has not had much success to show in Jharkhand. Hemant Soren, out on bail, is another shot in the opposition's arm ahead of the Jharkhand Assembly polls.\n",
            "The reason Kejriwal wants Delhi polls in November is to use the Opposition attacks in the other states as a tailwind.\n",
            "The AAP might be trying to capitalise on broader anti-BJP sentiment, which would get amped up due to the polls in Maharashtra and Jharkhand. Kejriwal's resignation and call for early elections must have been strategically timed to leverage that anti-BJP noise for Delhi's 70-seat Assembly election too.\n",
            "The coordinated anti-BJP narratives could amplify the campaign noise, helping the AAP to build a stronger opposition narrative ahead of the Delhi elections.5. KEJRIWAL MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED CENTRAL RULE IN DELHI\n",
            "One of the most critical factors behind Kejriwal's resignation could be the looming threat of Central Rule. While Kejriwal was jailed for months, several BJP leaders had demanded the imposition of President's rule in Delhi, citing the failure to carry out day-to-day governance affairs. The BJP had also hit out at Kejriwal, saying he clung to power all this while. \n",
            "After Kejriwal's release last week, had he continued as the Delhi CM, the central government, led by the BJP, could have cited policy paralysis, given Kejriwal's bail conditions. Moreover, imposing central rule could potentially delay the Delhi elections by up to six months.\n",
            "Continuing under tough bail conditions had already hampered the AAP government's ability to implement key policies, which could have further hurt the party's electoral prospects.\n",
            "The Supreme court, while bailing Kejriwal out, had prevented him from visiting the CM's office and the secretariat. \"The only category of files he [Kejriwal] must sign and does sign are the ones which have to go to the Lieutenant Governor,\" Arvind Kejriwal's counsel in the liquor policy case, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, told India Today TV.\n",
            "Kejriwal has not only avoided the imposition of central rule, but also put the AAP at an advantage by announcing, just months ahead of the Assembly election in Delhi, that he would resign.Published By: Sushim MukulPublished On: Sep 16, 2024\n",

            "The policy was introduced by AAP in 2021, saying it would curb black market sales, increase revenues and ensure even distribution of liquor licences.\n",

            "At 43, Atishi has become the youngest and third woman to serve as chief minister of Delhi.\n",
            "She currently holds important portfolios such as water, finance, power and education in Delhi's cabinet. \n",

He was the chief minister from 2013 to 2014 and from 2015 to 2024. He is also the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) since 2012. He has represented the New Delhi constituency in the Delhi Legislative Assembly since 2015 and from 2013 to 2014.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2006, Kejriwal was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his involvement in the Parivartan movement using right to information legislation in a campaign against government corruption. The same year, after resigning from government service, he founded the Public Cause Research Foundation to campaign for transparent governance. Before entering politics, Kejriwal had worked in the Indian Revenue Service. Prior to that, he was a mechanical engineer from IIT Kharagpur.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2012, he launched the AAP. In 2013, he assumed office as the Chief Minister of Delhi and resigned 49 days later over his inability to mobilise support for his proposed anti-corruption legislation. In the 2015 Delhi Legislative assembly elections, the AAP registered an unprecedented majority. In subsequent 2020 elections, AAP re-emerged victorious and retained power in Delhi, following which, Kejriwal was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Delhi for the third time in a row. Outside Delhi, his party registered another major victory in 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election.\n",
            "\n",
            "He was arrested on 21 March 2024 by the Enforcement Directorate on allegations of a liquor scam against the Aam Aadmi Party led Delhi Government.[1][2] He became the first ever sitting chief minister in India to be arrested.[3] His other party leaders, Satyendra Jain, Sanjay Singh and Manish Sisodia have also spent months to years in jail without bail, trial or conviction.[4] The opposition alliance called the arrest weeks before the 2024 Indian general election, a case of fabrication and \"match-fixing\" by the BJP. Amnesty International said that financial and terrorism laws have been weaponised to go after political opponents.[5] On 10 May, the Supreme Court ordered Kejriwal's release on interim bail until 1 June 2024, on account of campaigning for the election.[6][7] Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar Jail after the expiry of his bail period on 2 June 2024. On 13 September 2024, he was granted bail by Supreme Court  with certain conditions, the case still continues.[8] On 17 September 2024, he resigned as Delhi Chief Minister saying he will only become CM again if he receives a public mandate.[9]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kejriwal was born in an Agrawal[10] family of Baniyas in Siwani in the Bhiwani district of Haryana, India on 16 August 1968, the first of the three children of Gobind Ram Kejriwal and Gita Devi. His father was an electrical engineer who graduated from the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. Kejriwal spent most of his childhood in north Indian towns such as Sonipat, Ghaziabad and Hisar. He was educated at Campus School in Hisar[11] and at Holy Child School at Sonipat.[12] In 1985, he took the IIT-JEE exam and scored All India Rank (AIR) of 563.[13] He graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, majoring in mechanical engineering.[14]\n",

            "He joined Tata Steel in 1989 and was posted in Jamshedpur, Bihar. Kejriwal resigned in 1992, having taken leave of absence to study for the Civil Services Examination.[11] He spent some time in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), where he met Mother Teresa, and volunteered with The Missionaries of Charity and at the Ramakrishna Mission in North-East India and at Nehru Yuva Kendra.[15][16]\n",

            "Arvind Kejriwal joined the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) as an Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax in 1995, after qualifying through the Civil Services Examination.[17][18][19] In February 2006, he resigned from his position as Joint Commissioner of Income Tax in New Delhi.[17]\n",

            "\n",
            "In December 1999, while still in service with the Income Tax Department, Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and others founded a movement named Parivartan (which means \"change\"), in the Sundar Nagar area of Delhi. A month later, in January 2000, Kejriwal took a sabbatical from work to focus on Parivartan.[20][21]\n",
            "\n",
            "Parivartan addressed citizens' grievances related to Public Distribution System (PDS), public works, social welfare schemes, income tax and electricity. It was not a registered NGO - it ran on individual donations, and was characterised as a jan andolan (\"people's movement\") by its members.[22] Later, in 2005, Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia launched Kabir, a registered NGO named after the medieval philosopher Kabir. Like Parivartan, Kabir was also focused on RTI and participatory governance. However, unlike Parivartan, it accepted institutional donations. According to Kejriwal, Kabir was mainly run by Sisodia.[23]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2000, Parivartan filed a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding transparency in public dealings of the Income Tax department, and also organised a satyagraha outside the Chief Commissioner's office.[24] Kejriwal and other activists also stationed themselves outside the electricity department, asking visitors not to pay bribes and offered to help them in getting work done for free.[25]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2001, the Delhi government enacted a state-level Right To Information (RTI) Act, which allowed the citizens to access government records for a small fee. Parivartan used RTI to help people get their work done in government departments without paying a bribe. In 2002, the group obtained official reports on 68 public works projects in the area, and performed a community-led audit to expose misappropriations worth ₹ 7 million in 64 of the projects.[21] On 14 December 2002, Parivartan organised a Jan sunvai (public hearing), in which the citizens held public officials and leaders accountable for the lack of development in their locality.[26]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2003 (and again in 2008[27]), Parivartan exposed a PDS scam, in which ration shop dealers were siphoning off subsidised foodgrains in collusion with civic officials. In 2004, Parivartan used RTI applications to access communication between government agencies and the World Bank, regarding a project for privatisation of water supply. Kejriwal and other activists questioned the huge expenditure on the project and argued that it would hike water tariffs ten-fold, thus effectively cutting off the water supply to the city's poor. The project was stalled as a result of Parivartan's activism. Another campaign by Parivartan led to a court order that required private schools, which had received public land at discounted prices, to admit more than 700 poor kids without a fee.[24][25]\n",
            "\n",
            "Along with other social activists like Anna Hazare, Aruna Roy and Shekhar Singh, Kejriwal came to be recognised as an important contributor to the campaign for a national-level Right to Information Act (enacted in 2005).[24] He resigned from his job in February 2006, and later that year, he was given the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership, for his involvement with Parivartan.[28] The award recognised him for activating the RTI movement at the grassroots and empowering New Delhi's poor citizens to fight corruption.[25]\n",
            "\n",
            "By 2012, Parivartan was largely inactive. Sundar Nagri, where the movement was concentrated, suffered from irregular water supply, unreliable PDS system and poorly done public works.[22] Calling it \"ephemeral and delusionary in nature\", Kejriwal noted that Parivartan's success was limited, and the changes brought by it did not last long.[29]\n",
            "\n",
            "In December 2006, Kejriwal established the Public Cause Research Foundation in December 2006, together with Manish Sisodia and Abhinandan Sekhri. He donated his Ramon Magsaysay Award prize money as a seed fund. Besides the three founders, Prashant Bhushan and Kiran Bedi served as the Foundation's trustees.[30] This new body paid the employees of Parivartan.[22] Kejriwal used the RTI Act in corruption cases in many government departments including the Income Tax Department, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the Public Distribution System and the Delhi Electricity Board.[15]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2010, Kejriwal protested against corruption in the Commonwealth Games. He argued that the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) did not have any powers to take any action against the guilty, while CBI was incapable of launching an unbiased investigation against the ministers who controlled it. He advocated appointment of public ombudsman - Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in states.[31]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2011, Kejriwal joined several other activists, including Anna Hazare and Kiran Bedi, to form the India Against Corruption (IAC) group. The IAC demanded enactment of the Jan Lokpal Bill, which would result in a strong ombudsman. The campaign evolved into the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement. In response to the campaign, the government's advisory body - the National Advisory Council - drafted a Lokpal Bill. However, the NAC's Bill was criticised by Kejriwal and other activists on the grounds that it did not have enough powers to take action against the prime minister, other corrupt officeholders, and the judiciary. The activists also criticised the procedure for the selection of Lokpal, the transparency clauses and the proposal to disallow the Lokpal from taking cognizance of public grievances.[32]\n",
            "\n",
            "Amid continuing protests, the Government constituted a committee to Draft a Jan Lokpal Bill. Kejriwal was one of the civil society representative members of this committee. However, he alleged that the IAC activists had an unequal position in the committee, and the government appointees kept ignoring their recommendations. The Government argued that the activists could not be allowed to blackmail the elected representatives through protests. Kejriwal retorted that democratically elected representatives could not be allowed to function like dictators, and asked for a public debate on the contentious issues.[33]\n",
            "\n",
            "The IAC activists intensified their protests, and Anna Hazare organised a hunger strike. Kejriwal and other activists were arrested for defying a police directive to give a written undertaking that they will not go to JP Park. Kejriwal attacked the government on this and said there was a need for a debate over police power to detain and release people at will.[34][35] In August 2011, a settlement was reached between the Government and the activists.[36]\n",
            "\n",
            "Besides the government, the Jan Lokpal movement was also criticised by some citizens as 'undemocratic' on the grounds that the ombudsman had powers over elected representatives. Arundhati Roy claimed that the movement was not a people's movement; instead, it was funded by foreigners to influence policymaking in India. She pointed out that the Ford Foundation had funded the Emergent Leadership category of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and also donated $397,000 to Kejriwal's NGO Kabir.[37] Both Kejriwal and Ford Foundation termed the allegations as baseless, stating that the donations were made to support the RTI campaigns. Besides, several other Indian organisations had also received grants from the Ford Foundation.[38][39] Kejriwal also denied the allegations that the movement was a plot against the ruling Congress by the RSS, or that it was an upper-caste conspiracy against the Dalits.[23]\n",
            "\n",
            "By January 2012, the Government had backtracked on its promise to implement a strong Jan Lokpal, resulting in another series of protests from Kejriwal and his fellow activists. These protests attracted lower participation compared to the 2011 protests.[40] By mid-2012, Kejriwal had replaced Anna Hazare as the face of the remaining protestors.[41] In January 2014, Kejriwal said that he will quit from the government if Jan Lokpal Bill is not passed.[42]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2015, during the second term of the AAP government in Delhi, the Jan Lokpal Bill was passed by the assembly awaiting the president's approval.[43]\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the major criticisms directed at the Jan Lokpal activists was that they had no right to dictate terms to the elected representatives. As a result, Kejriwal and other activists decided to enter politics and contest elections.[44] In November 2012, they formally launched the Aam Aadmi Party; Kejriwal was elected as the party's National Convener. The party name reflects the phrase Aam Aadmi, or \"common man\", whose interests Kejriwal proposed to represent.[45] The establishment of AAP caused a rift between Kejriwal and Hazare.[46]\n",

If you want a clean, honest government, you can vote for AAP. The other option is to vote for the BJP directly or indirectly. Indirect voting is when you vote for the Congress, that Congress man will win and go to the BJP.\"[48] Later on in September 2022, 8 out of 11 Congress MLAs joined BJP.\n",

            "He was arrested on 21 March 2024 by the Enforcement Directorate on allegations of a Delhi liquor scam against Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi Government.[1][2] He became the first ever incumbent chief minister in India to be arrested while still holding the post.[3] The ED also accused him of spying on their officials.[155][156] He had skipped nine summons by the Enforcement Directorate as well, before that.[157] The Delhi High Court dismissed Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's petition against his arrest.[163] He was granted bail by the Delhi High Court on 20 June 2024.[164] His ministers, Satyendra Jain and Manish Sisodia have also been in jail without bail, trial or conviction with the exception of a bail to the former once for treatment. Satyendra Jain spent more than two years in jail.[4] Manish Sisodia was granted bail by the Supreme Court on 9 August 2024.[165] The opposition alliance called the arrest weeks before the 2024 Indian general election a case of fabrication and \"match-fixing\" by the BJP. Amnesty International said that financial and terrorism laws have been weaponised to go after political opponents while the BJP has denied that it had any political agenda to go after Kejriwal.[5] On 20 June 2024, Kejriwal was released on bail after paying bail bond of one lakh Indian Rupees.[98] His bail was put on hold before release as ED appealed against Kejriwal's bail.[166] On 20 June, he was granted bail but his release was delayed due to an ED appeal.[98] The CBI arrested him on 26 June, extending his custody to 12 July.[99][100] On 12 July, the Supreme Court granted him interim bail for alleged Delhi liquor policy money laundering case, but he remains in jail in CBI case related to alleged Liquor policy scam.[102] On 5 September 2024, the Supreme court upheld Delhi High Court's order of not granting bail to Kejriwal.[103] On 13 September 2024, Kejriwal was granted bail by Supreme Court with certain conditions as Delhi CM. However the investigation pertaining to the case is still continuing.[8]\n",

            "Alexander Emerick Jones (born February 11, 1974) is an American far-right[1] radio show host and prominent conspiracy theorist.[a][4] He hosts The Alex Jones Show from Austin, Texas, which is the longest-running online news and politics talk show, and was previously broadcast[5] by the Genesis Communications Network across the United States via syndicated and internet radio.[6] He is the founder of InfoWars and Banned.Video, websites that promote conspiracy theories and fake news.[7][8][9]\n",
            "\n",
            "Among many other conspiracy theories, Jones has alleged that the United States government either concealed information about or outright falsified the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the Oklahoma City bombing, the September 11 attacks, and the 1969 Moon landing.[10] He has also claimed that several governments and large businesses have colluded to create a globalist \"New World Order\" through \"manufactured economic crises, sophisticated surveillance tech and—above all—inside-job terror attacks that fuel exploitable hysteria\".[11] Jones has provided a platform for white nationalists and neo-Nazis on his website, Banned.Video, as well as providing an \"entry point\" to their ideology.[12] In 2023, leaked texts from Jones's phone revealed that he created the website National File to evade social media bans on InfoWars content.[13][14]\n",
            "\n",
            "A longtime critic of Republican and Democratic foreign and security policy, Jones supported Donald Trump's 2016 presidential bid and continued to support him as a savior from an alleged criminal bipartisan cabal controlling the federal government, despite also falling out with Trump over several of his policies, including airstrikes against the Assad regime.[15][16][17] A staunch supporter of Trump's re-election, Jones also supported the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. On January 6, 2021, Jones was a speaker at the rally in Lafayette Square Park supporting Trump preceding the latter's supporters' attack on the US Capitol.[18]\n",
            "\n",
            "In October 2022, for Jones's defamatory falsehoods about the Sandy Hook shooting, juries in Connecticut and Texas awarded a total of $1.487 billion in damages from Jones to a first responder and families of victims; the plaintiffs alleged that Jones's lies led to them being threatened and harassed for years.[11][19][20] On December 2, 2022, Jones filed for personal bankruptcy.[21]\n",
            "\n",
            "Alexander Emerick Jones was born on February 11, 1974,[22][23] in Dallas, Texas, and was raised in Rockwall, 25 miles east of Dallas. His father was a dentist from Austin[24][25] and his mother was a homemaker.[11] He says he has English, German, Scottish, and Irish descent.[26][27][28] The family moved to Austin in Jones's second year of high school. He attended Anderson High School, where he played football and graduated in 1993.[11] After graduating, Jones briefly attended Austin Community College before dropping out.[29]\n",
            "\n",
            "As a teenager, he read None Dare Call It Conspiracy, a book by John Birch Society conspiracy theorist Gary Allen, which alleged global bankers controlled American politics rather than elected officials.[30] It had a profound influence on him, and Jones has described Allen's work as \"the easiest-to-read primer on The New World Order\".[11]\n",
            "\n",
            "The Waco siege at the Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas, had an impact on Jones. It ended in April 1993, near the end of Jones's senior year of high school, with a substantial fire and a significant number of fatalities. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), these events \"only confirmed his belief in the inexorable progress of unseen, malevolent forces\". It was at this time he started to host a call-in show on public access television (PACT/ACTV) in Austin.[3]\n",
            "\n",
            "The Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, was intended by perpetrator Timothy McVeigh as a response to the federal involvement in the botched resolution of the Waco siege on its second anniversary.[3][31] Jones began accusing the federal government of having caused it: \"I understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control\".[11] He did not believe the bombing had been the responsibility of McVeigh and his associate Terry Nichols.[31] In 1998, he released his first film, America Destroyed by Design.[citation needed]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1998, Jones organized a successful campaign to build a new Branch Davidian church as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire.[32] He often discussed the project on his public-access television program. He claimed that David Koresh and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms during the siege.[33]\n",
            "\n",
            "Jones began his career in Austin working on a live, call-in format public-access cable television program.[34] In 1996, Jones switched to radio, hosting a show named The Final Edition on KJFK (98.9 FM).[33] Influenced by radio host William Cooper, who phoned in to Jones's early shows, Jones began to broadcast about the New World Order conspiracy theory at this time.[31]\n",
            "\n",
            "While running for Congress, Ron Paul was a guest on his show several times.[35] In 1999, Jones tied with Shannon Burke for that year's poll of \"Best Austin Talk Radio Host\", as voted by readers of The Austin Chronicle.[36] Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. The station's operations manager said that Jones's views made it difficult for the station to sell advertising.[33] Jones said:\n",

We need to understand we're under attack, and we need to understand this is 21st-century warfare and get on a war-footing\".[212] In the same video, before setting off toward the Capitol building, Jones told the crowd: \"We're here to take our rightful country back peacefully, because we're not globalist, antifa criminals.

He said Jones' failure to attend court during his testimony was a \"cowardly act\".[248] While Heslin was testifying, Jones was broadcasting his show, calling Heslin \"slow\" and \"manipulated by some very bad people\".[248] Jones subsequently arrived at court to present his testimony, first sitting through that of Jesse's mother Scarlett Lewis. Lewis said, \"Alex, I want you to hear this. We're more polarized than ever as a country. Some of that is because of you.\" She asked Jones: \"Do you think I'm an actor?\" Jones responded, \"No, I don't think you're an actor.\"[248] As the only person testifying in his defense, Jones admitted the Sandy Hook shooting was \"100% real\", and agreed with his own attorney that it was \"absolutely irresponsible\" to push falsehoods about the shooting and its victims.[249]\n",

On August 3, cross-examination revealed that Jones had not fully complied with court orders to provide text messages and emails for pretrial evidence gathering.[250] Judge Maya Guerra Gamble of Travis County District Court admonished him for lying under oath, as his failure to comply with court orders was the reason he lost the defamation suits, and that bankruptcy proceedings had yet to be adjudicated. Gamble said, \"You're under oath. That means things must actually be true when you say them.\"[248] After the judge left the courtroom, Jones said Lewis and Heslin were being \"controlled\".[249] While the jury deliberated the amount of compensatory damages, Jones was claiming on his radio show that the proceedings were \"an incredible spectacle\" backed by globalists trying to shut him down.[251] On August 4, 2022, the jury ordered Jones pay Heslin and Lewis $4.1 million in compensatory damages,[252][253] and the following day, he was ordered to pay an additional $45.2 million in punitive damages.[254][255][256] On November 22, 2022, a judge ruled that Jones must pay the full amount of the punitive damages,[257] even though this amount exceeds a cap under Texas law.

            "Alexander Emerick Jones (born February 11, 1974) is an American far-right[1] radio show host and prominent conspiracy theorist.[a][4] He hosts The Alex Jones Show from Austin, Texas, which is the longest-running online news and politics talk show, and was previously broadcast[5] by the Genesis Communications Network across the United States via syndicated and internet radio.[6] He is the founder of InfoWars and Banned.Video, websites that promote conspiracy theories and fake news.[7][8][9]\n",
            "\n",
            "Among many other conspiracy theories, Jones has alleged that the United States government either concealed information about or outright falsified the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the Oklahoma City bombing, the September 11 attacks, and the 1969 Moon landing.[10] He has also claimed that several governments and large businesses have colluded to create a globalist \"New World Order\" through \"manufactured economic crises, sophisticated surveillance tech and—above all—inside-job terror attacks that fuel exploitable hysteria\".[11] Jones has provided a platform for white nationalists and neo-Nazis on his website, Banned.Video, as well as providing an \"entry point\" to their ideology.[12] In 2023, leaked texts from Jones's phone revealed that he created the website National File to evade social media bans on InfoWars content.[13][14]\n",
            "\n",
            "A longtime critic of Republican and Democratic foreign and security policy, Jones supported Donald Trump's 2016 presidential bid and continued to support him as a savior from an alleged criminal bipartisan cabal controlling the federal government, despite also falling out with Trump over several of his policies, including airstrikes against the Assad regime.[15][16][17] A staunch supporter of Trump's re-election, Jones also supported the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. On January 6, 2021, Jones was a speaker at the rally in Lafayette Square Park supporting Trump preceding the latter's supporters' attack on the US Capitol.[18]\n",
            "\n",
            "In October 2022, for Jones's defamatory falsehoods about the Sandy Hook shooting, juries in Connecticut and Texas awarded a total of $1.487 billion in damages from Jones to a first responder and families of victims; the plaintiffs alleged that Jones's lies led to them being threatened and harassed for years.[11][19][20] On December 2, 2022, Jones filed for personal bankruptcy.[21]\n",

            "Alexander Emerick Jones was born on February 11, 1974,[22][23] in Dallas, Texas, and was raised in Rockwall, 25 miles east of Dallas. His father was a dentist from Austin[24][25] and his mother was a homemaker.[11] He says he has English, German, Scottish, and Irish descent.[26][27][28] The family moved to Austin in Jones's second year of high school. He attended Anderson High School, where he played football and graduated in 1993.[11] After graduating, Jones briefly attended Austin Community College before dropping out.[29]\n",
            "\n",
            "As a teenager, he read None Dare Call It Conspiracy, a book by John Birch Society conspiracy theorist Gary Allen, which alleged global bankers controlled American politics rather than elected officials.[30] It had a profound influence on him, and Jones has described Allen's work as \"the easiest-to-read primer on The New World Order\".[11]\n",

            "Waco siege and Oklahoma bombing\n",
            "\n",
            "The Waco siege at the Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas, had an impact on Jones. It ended in April 1993, near the end of Jones's senior year of high school, with a substantial fire and a significant number of fatalities. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), these events \"only confirmed his belief in the inexorable progress of unseen, malevolent forces\". It was at this time he started to host a call-in show on public access television (PACT/ACTV) in Austin.[3]\n",
            "\n",
            "The Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, was intended by perpetrator Timothy McVeigh as a response to the federal involvement in the botched resolution of the Waco siege on its second anniversary.[3][31] Jones began accusing the federal government of having caused it: \"I understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control\".[11] He did not believe the bombing had been the responsibility of McVeigh and his associate Terry Nichols.[31] In 1998, he released his first film, America Destroyed by Design.[citation needed]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1998, Jones organized a successful campaign to build a new Branch Davidian church as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire.[32] He often discussed the project on his public-access television program. He claimed that David Koresh and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms during the siege.[33]\n",
            "\n",
            "Early broadcasting career\n",
            "\n",
            "Jones began his career in Austin working on a live, call-in format public-access cable television program.[34] In 1996, Jones switched to radio, hosting a show named The Final Edition on KJFK (98.9 FM).[33] Influenced by radio host William Cooper, who phoned in to Jones's early shows, Jones began to broadcast about the New World Order conspiracy theory at this time.[31]\n",
            "\n",
            "While running for Congress, Ron Paul was a guest on his show several times.[35] In 1999, Jones tied with Shannon Burke for that year's poll of \"Best Austin Talk Radio Host\", as voted by readers of The Austin Chronicle.[36] Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. The station's operations manager said that Jones's views made it difficult for the station to sell advertising.[33] Jones said:\n",
            "\n",
            "It was purely political, and it came down from on high ... I was told 11 weeks ago to lay off Bill Clinton, to lay off all these politicians, to not talk about rebuilding the church, to stop bashing the Marines, A to Z.[33]\n",

            "In about 1999, Jones founded with his then-wife Kelly Jones the website InfoWars, initially as a mail-order outlet for the sale of their conspiracy-oriented videos.[30] Over time, InfoWars, with Jones as its publisher and director, became a prominent fake news website centered on promoting conspiracy theories.[37][41] In November 2016, the InfoWars website received approximately 10 million visits, making its reach more extensive than mainstream news websites such as The Economist and Newsweek.[42] Another of Jones's websites is PrisonPlanet.com.[43]\n",

            "\n",
            "After his firing from KJFK-FM, Jones began to broadcast his own show by Internet connection from his home.[11] In July 2000, a group of Austin Community Access Center (ACAC) radio hosts claimed that Jones had used legal proceedings and ACAC policy to intimidate them or try to get their broadcasts removed.[44] In 2001, Jones's radio show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations.[11]\n",
            "\n",
            "On the day of the 9/11 attacks, Jones said on his radio show there was a \"98 percent chance this was a government-orchestrated controlled bombing\".[45] He began promoting the conspiracy theory that the Bush administration was behind the attack.[46] As a result, several stations dropped Jones's program, according to columnist Will Bunch.[47] Jones became a leading figure of the \"9/11 truther\" cause.[48] In 2010, the show attracted around two million listeners each week.[49] According to Alexander Zaitchik of Rolling Stone magazine, in 2011 Jones had a larger on-line audience than Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh combined.[11] In 2020, The Alex Jones Show was syndicated nationally by the Genesis Communications Network to more than 100 AM and FM radio stations in the United States.[50]\n",
            "\n",
            "According to journalist Will Bunch, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America,[51][52] the show has a demographic that leans more towards younger listeners than do other conservative pundits, due to Jones's \"highly conspiratorial tone and Web-oriented approach\". Bunch also stated that Jones \"feed[s] on the deepest paranoia\".[47]\n",
            "\n",
            "Jones told The Washington Post in November 2016 that his radio show, then syndicated to 129 stations, had a daily audience of five million listeners and his video streams had topped 80 million viewers in a single month.[43]\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "A 2017 piece for German magazine Der Spiegel by Veit Medick indicated that two-thirds of Jones's funds derive from sales of his own products. These products are marketed through the InfoWars website and through advertising spots on Jones's show. They include dietary supplements, toothpaste, bulletproof vests and \"brain pills\", which hold \"an appeal for anyone who believes Armageddon is near\", according to Medick.[55] From September 2015 to the end of 2018, the InfoWars store made $165 million in sales, according to court filings relating to the Sandy Hook lawsuits filed against Jones.[56]\n",

            "In August 2017, Californian medical company Labdoor, Inc reported on tests applied to six of Jones's dietary supplement products. These included a product named Survival Shield, which was found by Labdoor to contain only iodine, and a product named Oxy-Powder, which comprised a compound of magnesium oxide and citric acid—common ingredients in dietary supplements. Labdoor indicated no evidence of prohibited or harmful substances, but cast doubt on the marketing claims for these products, and asserted that the quantity of the ingredients in certain products would be \"too low to be appropriately effective\".[57][58][59]\n",
            "\n",
            "On a 2017 segment of Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver stated that Jones spends \"nearly a quarter\" of his on-air time promoting products sold on his website, many of which are purported solutions to medical and economic problems claimed to be caused by the conspiracy theories described on his show.[60][61]\n",

            "Jones continued his promotion of supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 12, 2020, Jones was issued a cease and desist from the Attorney General of New York, after he claimed, in the absence of any evidence, that products he sold, including colloidal silver toothpaste, were an effective treatment for COVID-19.[63][64][65] The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also sent him a letter on April 9, 2020, warning that the federal government might proceed to seize the products he was marketing for COVID-19 or fine him if he continued to sell them.[66] A disclaimer then appeared on Jones's website, stating his products were not intended for treating \"the novel coronavirus\". On a linked page, Jones was quoted: \"They plan on, if they've fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance, on killing you.\" Jones continued to sell the products.[63]\n",
            "\n",
            "According to leaked text messages from Jones's mobile phone, InfoWars sold VasoBeet, a product it described as a \"powerful beet formula\", at a 900% retail markup as of September 2019. On January 29, 2020, InfoWars pulled in $245,000 in food sales, a day after Jones stoked fear about food shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in a broadcast.[13]\n",

            "During the April 2022 InfoWars bankruptcy hearing, Jones's representative stated, \"InfoWars is a prominent trademark in the conspiracy theory community and Alex Jones is equally as prominent\".

            "\n",

            "In February 2018, YouTube issued a \"strike\" against the InfoWars channel after a video was posted in which Alex Jones accused David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland school shooting, of being a paid \"crisis actor\". YouTube removed the video for violating its policies against harassment and bullying.[70]\n",

            "On July 24, 2018,[71] YouTube removed four InfoWars' videos citing \"child endangerment and hate speech\",[72][73] issued another \"strike\" against the channel, and suspended the ability to live stream.[71][73] On July 27, 2018, Facebook suspended Jones's profile for 30 days, and removed the same videos, saying they violated the website's standards against hate speech and bullying.[74][71] On August 3, 2018, Stitcher Radio removed all of his podcasts, citing harassment.[75]\n",
            "\n",
            "Later that year, on August 6, 2018, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify removed all content by Jones and InfoWars for policy violations. YouTube removed channels associated with InfoWars, including The Alex Jones Channel, stating that InfoWars had repeatedly attempted to post content similar to that which had already been removed, as well as attempting to circumvent the suspension of its live streaming privileges by having other users live stream on its behalf.[76] On Facebook, four pages associated with InfoWars and Alex Jones were removed over repeated policy violations. Apple removed all podcasts associated with Jones from iTunes.[77] Facebook cited instances of dehumanizing immigrants, Muslims and transgender people, as well as glorification of violence, as examples of hate speech.[78][79] After InfoWars was banned from Facebook, Jones used another of his websites, NewsWars, to circumvent the ban.[80][81]\n",

            "In September, Jones was permanently banned from Twitter and Periscope after comments about CNN reporter Oliver Darcy.[92][93] On September 7, 2018, the InfoWars app was removed from the Apple App Store for \"objectionable content\".[94] He was banned from using PayPal for business transactions, having violated the company's policies by expressing \"hate or discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions\".[95] After Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter, several previously banned accounts were reinstated including Donald Trump, Andrew Tate and Ye, but Jones was not among them. In November 2022, Musk referred to Jones as a person who \"would use the deaths of children for gain, politics or fame\" and said Jones would not be unbanned.[96] He changed his position on December 10, 2023, when he reinstated Jones's account citing that if Jones said something false, Community Notes would correct him.[97][98]\n",

            "On October 12, 2022,[274] the jury awarded $965 million to be shared by 15 plaintiffs (eight families and one first responder). The plaintiffs' individual awards ranged from $28.8 million to $120 million.[275] During the trial, the families testified that they had been threatened and harassed over years due to Jones' falsehoods.[238][20] Jones reacted live to the verdict on his show, mocking it: \"Do these people actually think they're getting any money?\" He implored his viewers to donate to him to \"appeal\", and also declared that the jury's verdict was an attempt to \"scare us away from questioning\" school shootings such as the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and the Robb Elementary School shooting, but \"we're not going to stop\".[276]\n",

The suit claims Jones \"conspired to divert his assets to shell companies owned by insiders like his parents, his children, and himself\".[283][284] The lawsuit alleges Jones drew $18 million from the Infowars company beginning in 2018 and accuses Jones of claiming a \"dubious\" $54 million debt at about the same time to another company alleged by the lawsuit to be also owned by Jones.[283] Norm Pattis, an attorney for Jones, said the lawsuit was \"ridiculous\" and denied that there had been any attempt to conceal assets.[283]\n",

The three companies affected were InfoW, Prison Planet TV, and IWHealth (or Infowars Health).[286][287] The court filings estimated InfoWars' assets at between $0–$50,000, but its liabilities (including from the damages awarded against Jones in defamation suits) were stated as being between $1 million and $10 million.[288] Regarding why Jones did not personally file for bankruptcy, his representative stated, \"It would ruin his name and harm his ability to sell merchandise.\" and \"Putting him in bankruptcy would harm his trademark value in terms of cashflow.\"[67] A lawyer for the families involved in a Connecticut lawsuit against Jones responded, \"Alex Jones is just delaying the inevitable: a public trial in which he will be held accountable for his profit-driven campaign of lies against the Sandy Hook families who have brought this lawsuit.\"[68]\n",
            "\n",
            "On June 10, 2022, a federal judge in Texas dismissed the bankruptcy protection case after Jones and the families agreed that the three companies would be dropped from the defamation lawsuits against Jones, allowing them to continue in Texas and Connecticut.[289] On July 29, 2022, the parent company of InfoWars, Free Speech Systems, LLC, filed for bankruptcy.[287] In response to the Connecticut legal settlement made against him, Jones had previously claimed assets of $6.2 million in January 2022.[290]\n",
            "\n",
            "On December 2, 2022, Jones filed for Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy in the Southern District of Texas, claiming that his assets were between $1 million and $10 million, while his debts were between $1 billion and $10 billion.[291][292] He also claimed that he had 50 to 99 creditors,[291][292] and in February 2023, that the Department of Justice intended to seize his pet cat, valued at $2,000, to pay debts owed to the Sandy Hook families.[293][294][295] On October 19, 2023, a Texas bankruptcy judge ruled that Jones cannot rely on bankruptcy protection to avoid paying the $1.5 billion he owes to the Sandy Hook families as a result of the Connecticut lawsuit. It remained unclear whether he would be able to reduce the amount of punitive damages in the Texas case.[296]\n",
            "\n",
            "In November 2023, the Sandy Hook families offered a settlement in which Jones would pay $85 million over 10 years (about 6 percent of what he had been court-ordered to pay). The offer was filed within Jones's personal bankruptcy case.[297] The following month, Jones countered with an offer of $55 million over 10 years.[298] In February 2024, Jones's general unsecured creditors (mostly Sandy Hook families) voted in favor of a Chapter 11 plan that would liquidate and redistribute his assets.[299]\n",

I'm not trying to be dramatic here, but it's been a hard fight. These people hate our children.\" The next day, the families filed an emergency motion in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, asking the judge to liquidate Alex Jones's company rather than allow him to reorganize it. The court filing said Jones has \"failed to demonstrate any hope of beginning to satisfy\" their claims.[300] On June 6, Jones's attorneys filed a motion to convert his bankruptcy to Chapter 7 status, which would lead to liquidation of his personal assets, including his stake in InfoWars,[301] which was agreed to by the plaintiffs the following day.[302] On June 14, the judge approved the Chapter 7 liquidation.[303] On June 24, the court-appointed trustee public revealed that he planned to shut down InfoWars.[304] On September 24, the judge approved the sale of Free Speech Systems, the parent company of InfoWars.[305]\n",

The lawsuit was filed in Texas court naming Jones, InfoWars, parent company Free Speech Systems, LLC and Infowars employee Kit Daniels as defendants.[306][307] Fontaine's lawsuit was the first one against Jones that involved his defamatory statements about mass school shootings. One of his lawyers stated that \"Marcel Fontaine is the only reason why we filed the first Sandy Hook case\", because after Fontaine's suit was filed, the families of two boys slain in the Sandy Hook shooting contacted his law firm about also suing Jones.

She asserted that \"he's not a stable person\" and she was \"concerned that he is engaged in felonious behavior, threatening a member of Congress [ Adam Schiff ].\" His attorney responded by claiming that \"he's playing a character\" and describing him as a \"performance artist\".[311][312] On his show, Jones denied playing a character and he called his show \"the most bona fide, hard-core, real McCoy thing there is, and everybody knows it\";[313][314] whereas in court, Jones clarified that he generally agreed with his attorney's statement, but that he disagreed with the media's interpretation of the term \"performance artist\".[315] Kelly was awarded the right to decide where their children live while he maintains visitation rights.[316] In April 2020, a state district judge denied an emergency motion by Kelly to secure custody of their daughters for the next two weeks after Jones led a rally at the Capitol, where he was mobbed by supporters and called COVID-19 a hoax.[317] In 2023, after a 2008 audioclip of Jones berating his then wife was obtained by the Daily Mail, Kelly claimed that Jones was \"a total racist\" regarding her Jewish heritage, claiming that her genes were \"flawed.\"[318]\n",

The dense fog has impacted the movement of trains and flights to and from the national capital.At least 110 flights, including both domestic and international arrivals and departures, have been delayed at IGI due to the fog.The movement of trains has also been impacted due to low visibility.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for today and a yellow alert for Thursday for dense to very dense fog. Fog is classified as dense when visibility is between 50 metres and 200 metres.The IMD has forecasted foggy weather for the next three days. Tuesday too witnessed dense fog that reduced visibility at Palam to 50 metres. Along with that, Delhiites would breathe in excessively polluted air that could be in the \"severe\" AQI range on Wednesday.The temperature on Wednesday is likely to be 24 degrees Celsius at the maximum and 7 at the minimum. Although the skies will remain clear, a low ventilation index and unfavourable wind speed will mean that pollutants in the air are unlikely to get dispersed.On Tuesday morning, visibility at Palam remained abysmally low till 10 am. The visibility at Safdarjung was 200 metres.\"The fog will continue for the next few days. On Wednesday, there are chances of dense to very dense fog. The condition will remain so with visibility of 50 metres of lower during morning in all of north-west India, including Punjab, Haryana, Delhi-NCR, western and eastern UP and northern Rajasthan. The fog occurred due to night moisture, clear skies and low wind speed,\" Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist with IMD, said.The air quality, although not severe on Tuesday, was in the \"very poor\" range at 377, which was a marginal improvement from 383 on Monday.The air quality early warning system has predicted the \"severe\" AQI for Wednesday, saying that it could remain \"in the severe category from Thursday to Friday\".For the next 6 days, \"the predominant surface wind is likely to be from the north-west direction in Delhi with wind speeds up to 6 kmph, clear skies and dense to very dense fog in the morning on Thursday,\" said IITM\\'s air quality early warning system. It added that the ventilation index is likely to be 950 m2/s on Wednesday, 800 m2/s on Thursday and 950 m2/s on Friday over Delhi. A ventilation index lower than 6000 m2/s with average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants.The IITM\\'s decision support system showed that 16% of the city\\'s total PM2.5 level was because of transport, 7% because of industries and 27% because of other sources.Delhi is facing the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Stage III (severe category) curbs right now. This means construction and demolition has been halted and BS III petrol and BS IV diesel vehicles are barred from roads. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), which decides on the level of restrictions, said it will wait and watch before invoking GRAP Stage IV.On Tuesday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 7 degrees Celsius, a notch below the normal, which is 7.6 degrees Celsius, recorded a day earlier. The maximum temperature was 23.8 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal, against 23.6 degree a day earlier.', 'On Sunday morning, December 31, moderate to dense fog continues to cover several parts of North India, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. This is expected to continue till January 4, 2024, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\\n\\nAs per the national weather agency data, zero visibility was recorded in Jorhat (Assam), Pathankot and Bathinda (Punjab), Jammu (Jammu and Kashmir) and Agra (Uttar Pradesh). Visibility was 25 metres in Ambala (Haryana), 50 metres in Bikaner (Rajasthan), Patiala (Punjab), Chandigarh, Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh), Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh); and 200 metres in Amritsar (Punjab) and Hisar (Haryana).\\n\\nIn Delhi, at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the visibility was recorded at 800 metres, affecting the flight schedules. Due to this coldwave and fog conditions in North India, several trains were running late because of the poor visibility.\\n\\nThe weather department said very dense fog conditions (visibility 550 metres) were very likely to prevail over several parts of Punjab during the late evening to morning hours and over West Uttar Pradesh during midnight and morning hours from December 31 (Sunday) to January 4 (Thursday). The IMD predicted similar conditions over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and East Uttar Pradesh during midnight and morning hours until January 1 (Monday).\\n\\nUttarakhand may experience dense fog conditions (visibility 50-200 metres) in the early morning hours/morning hours from December 31 (Sunday) to January 4 (Thursday). Similar conditions were likely to prevail over north Madhya Pradesh, north Rajasthan and Jharkhand on December 31 (Sunday) and January 1 (Monday); Gangetic West Bengal on December 31 (Sunday), and Odisha, Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura from December 31 (Sunday) to January 2 (Tuesday), added IMD.\\n\\nThe weather agency added that cold day conditions were very likely to be in some parts of Punjab, Haryana, and isolated pockets of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and north Rajasthan till December 31 (Sunday).\\n\\nTalking about Central India, the IMD predicted a gradual rise in minimum temperatures by 2-3 degrees Celcius during the next two days, with significant change after that. A drop by 2-3 degrees Celsius in maximum temperatures is likely over many parts of Central and Northwest India during the next two and no significant change in minimum temperatures may occur in the rest parts of the country, said the IMD.', '', 'Delhi and its neighbouring areas woke up to a thick layer of fog on Christmas, lowering visibility as flight and train operations were affected due to the current weather conditions.\\n\\nAccording to the Railways, 20 trains to Delhi from various parts of the country were running late due to dense fog conditions. Flights, which are not equipped to land in low visibility conditions, were also affected.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Met Department has issued a yellow alert for today, warning of dense fog in the early morning hours and the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to be 22 degrees Celsius and 9 degrees Celsius, respectively.\\n\\nIn Safdarjung, Delhi\\'s official weather station, the maximum temperature today was recorded at 8.4 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal, while it was 9.6 degrees Celsius in Palam, which is within the normal range. Visibility at Safdarjung and Palam were at 100 metres.\\n\\nIn a tweet, the Delhi airport said while landings and takeoffs continue, flights which are not CAT III compliant could be affected.\\n\\n\"Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for updated flight information. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted,\" the airport said in its fog alert issued at 5:45 am.\\n\\nCAT III is a navigation system which allows planes to land during dense fog and inclement weather conditions when the visibility is low.\\n\\nIn another tweet posted at 1:40 am, the airport said low visibility procedures were in progress and flight operations were normal.\\n\\nAQI IMPROVES IN DELHI\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi was recorded at 334 as of 6 am today, which falls in the \\'very poor\\' category, down from yesterday\\'s 398 on Tuesday morning.\\n\\nOn Tuesday evening, several parts of Delhi received rain, improving the AQI marginally to 358, which also falls in the \\'very poor\\' category. The improved AQI resulted in the lifting of GRAP-IV curbs, which included a ban on all construction activities.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nOut of the 37 monitoring stations that recorded data, two -- Mundka, Nehru Nagar — recorded air quality in the \\'severe\\' category, 32 in the \\'very poor\\' category and the remaining in the \\'poor\\' category.\\n\\nAn AQI between 0 and 50 is considered \\'good\\', 51-100 \\'satisfactory\\', 101-200 \\'moderate\\', 201-300 \\'poor\\', 301-400 \\'very poor\\' and 401-500 \\'severe\\'.\\n\\nThe maximum temperature was recorded at 20.8 degrees Celsius, which was warmer than usual for the time of the season.

An official said three flights of SpiceJet and one flight of Air India were diverted to Jaipur between 0900 and 1200 hrs. Late in the evening, Vistara said five of its flights that were to land at the Delhi airport were diverted. At least five flights of Vistara were diverted due to bad weather in the national capital. In a series of posts on X late in the evening, the airline said the flight from Patna, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Guwahati and Chennai to the national capital have been diverted. Three flights were diverted to Indore and one flight each to Mumbai and Jaipur. Delhi airport issued a fog update at 2225 hours. \"While landing and takeoff continue at Delhi airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected,\" it said in a post on X. CAT III pertains to operating flights when the visibility is quite low. Several areas in the national capital were engulfed in dense fog on .', 'As Delhi has been grappling with severe cold in recent days, the flight operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) in the national capital have been badly hit due to a thick blanket of fog and the unavailability of CAT III-compliant runways.\\n\\nApart from reduced visibility, the situation got worse because Delhi Airport currently has only one CAT III-equipped runway for operations in low visibility. Runway 28/10 has been closed for scheduled re-carpeting since mid-September, according to ANI.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIGIA has two CAT III-compliant runways: the main airstrip 28/10 and the 29L/11R, which is closest to the Gurugram side. The other two runways, 11L/29R and 09/27, are not CAT III B-compliant runways.\\n\\nNot only that, but the Delhi airport also wrote to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) about a crane obstructing the view on the Gurugram end of the 29L/11R runway at the airport currently. This implies that one end of the only CAT III-compliant runway is unviable for landings during low visibility. IGIA has two CAT III-compliant runways: 28/10 and the 29L/11R. Runway 28/10 has been closed for repair work. (Infographic: Rahul Gupta/India Today)\\n\\nIn the letter accessed by India Today, which was also sent to J Kumar Infra (the company behind Dwarka E-Way) on 8/1/24, Delhi airport stated, \"Regrettably, it has come to our attention that subsequent to joint confirmation on 5th Jan 2024, one of the cranes was re-erected by M/s JKumar at 1900 hrs over the railway underpass near Sector 21, Dwarka against the provisions of SOP.\"\\n\\n“Unauthorised erection of the cranes, especially after the joint inspection and confirmation, poses a serious collision risk for low-flying aircraft, creating an avoidable dangerous situation apart from credibility challenges,” the letter stated.\\n\\nThe diversion of flights during fog also depends on pilots being CAT-III trained. Pilots with CAT-III training are qualified and certified for Category III instrument landing approaches.\\n\\nCategory III (CAT-III) refers to a set of international standards for precision instrument approach and landing in adverse weather conditions. It involves advanced autopilot and ground equipment that enables aircraft to land in very low visibility conditions, such as dense fog or heavy rain.\\n\\nFor suitably equipped aircraft, different ILS Facility Performance categories are mentioned as below:-\\n\\nCATEGORIES OF AIRPORT RUNAWAYS\\n\\nThere are three main categories of airport runways based on their instrument landing capabilities:\\n\\nCat I Operation:\\n\\nPrecision instrument approach and landing.\\n\\nDecision height not lower than 60m (200ft).\\n\\nVisibility not less than 800m or a runway visual range not less than 550m.\\n\\nCat II Operation:\\n\\nPrecision instrument approach and landing.\\n\\nDecision height lower than 60m (200ft) but not lower than 30m (100ft).\\n\\nRunway visual range not less than 350m.\\n\\nCat III Operation:\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nCAT III runways provide the highest level of instrument landing capability.

Visibility at IGI was zero at 3 am, but it improved later on.\\n\\nAmidst severe fog conditions, Delhi Airport issued an advisory for passengers, urging them to contact airlines before travelling. The airport authority stated on X (formerly Twitter), \"Due to dense fog, flight operations at Delhi Airport may be affected. Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for updated flight information.\" The post added, \"Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.\"\\n\\nGOVERNMENT RESPONDS\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nFollowing the chaos at Delhi airport due to fog and runway shortages, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia assured travellers that they are \"working round the clock.\"\\n\\nResponding to a flyer\\'s comment on X expressing frustration with Delhi airport having only one CAT III compliant runway at the moment, the Ministry of Civil Aviation clarified about the situation.\\n\\n\"This is not correct. All three operational runways at Delhi Airport, including a CAT III runway, were handling flight operations as per their capabilities yesterday, albeit with reduced capacity due to intense fog,\" the Ministry of Civil Aviation stated.\\n\\n\"Data from 5 AM to 9 AM shows that the CAT III Runway RWY 11R/29L handled 30 landings and 1 takeoff during the 4-hour period, whereas the non-CAT III Runway RWY 9/27 couldn’t handle any flight movement, and RWY 11L/29R handled 2 take-offs during the period,\" the ministry added.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nEarlier, Scindia wrote on X that they are \"trying their best\" to minimize passenger inconvenience. \"I would like to assure everyone that all stakeholders are working round the clock to minimize the fog-related impact,\" Scindia wrote on X.\\n\\n\"Yesterday, Delhi witnessed unprecedented fog wherein visibility fluctuated for several hours, and at times, dropped to zero between 5 AM to 9 AM. The authorities, therefore, were compelled to enforce a shutdown of operations for some time even on CAT III runways (CAT III runways cannot handle Zero-Visibility operations). The decision was taken keeping passenger safety in mind, which remains the foremost priority for all in the aviation ecosystem,\" he wrote.\\n\\nPublished By: Vivek Mishra Published On: Jan 15, 2024', 'Something went wrong. Wait a moment and try again.\\n\\nTry again', 'NEW DELHI: Delhi woke up to a blanket of dense fog on Wednesday, significantly reducing the visibility across the city to less than 50m affecting flights, rail and road traffic.\\n\\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) classifies fog intensity into four types -- shallow, moderate, dense and very dense fog. The visibility ranges from 999m to 500m, 499m to 200m, 199m to 50m and < 50m, respectively.\\n\\nAs the day unfolds, the fog is forecasted to gradually dissipate, revealing a clearer atmosphere by the afternoon.\\n\\nThe dense fog has led to increased caution in railway operations, affecting the departure and arrival times of trains.\\n\\nFlight schedules are also being affected, with many flights experiencing delays and some possibly facing cancellations.\\n\\nAs of 8 a.m., more than 40 flights have been delayed due to the ongoing dense fog. This includes disruptions in eight international departures, four international arrivals, 22 domestic departures and five domestic arrivals.\\n\\nDelhi airport has also issued an advisory, which reads: \"While landing and takeoffs continue at Delhi Airport, flights that are not CAT Ill compliant may get affected. Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for updated flight information. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.\"\\n\\nIn a fog-induced challenge for commuters, several trains arriving in the Delhi region are also dealing with delays, causing frustration among passengers.\\n\\n25 trains are trailing behind their scheduled arrival time, and the extent of delay varies across multiple routes.\\n\\nPuri-New Delhi Purushottam Express and Howrah-New Delhi Poorva Express are delayed by five hours, which is also the maximum number of hours delayed throughout the day.\\n\\nPassengers on or about to board Chennai-New Delhi Grand Trunk Express were also urged to check updated schedules due to delays of 4:40 hours.\\n\\nAmong 25 trains delayed, the Golden Temple Mail is also running behind schedule by 2: 38 hours.\\n\\nDelhi\\'s air quality remained in the \\'severe\\' category.\\n\\nThe AQI scale categorises levels from 0 to 500, with Anand Vihar breaching the \\'severe\\' threshold.\\n\\nAt the Anand Vihar area, PM2.5 levels remained into the \\'severe\\' category standing at 500 and PM10 reached 500, and CO plummeted to 118, classified as \\'moderate\\',\" according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).\\n\\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) between zero and 50 is considered \\'good\\'; 51 and 100 \\'satisfactory\\'; 101 and 200 \\'moderate\\'; 201 and 300 \\'poor\\'; 301 and 400 \\'very poor\\'; and 401 and 500 \\'severe\\'.\\n\\nThe Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport T3 witnessed PM2.5 levels at 437 and PM10 at 431, both falling under the \\'severe\\' category. The CO level was recorded at 132, maintaining a \\'moderate\\' rating.\\n\\nCommuters are urged to exercise caution during the morning hours due to reduced visibility caused by the lingering fog, and are urged to stay updated on real-time schedules and plan their journeys accordingly.', 'The maximum temperature in Delhi on Friday was recorded at 21.4 deg C while the minimum was 8.4 deg C. The India MetSky weather on Friday posted on X: “A dense (upper level) and surface fog covered the whole of Delhi and NCR on December 29. Many of the stations recorded their minimum temperature before the fog onset while some in the outskirts did after fog onset.”The IMD said cold wave conditions are very likely in some parts of Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh-Delhi and western UP.']\n",
